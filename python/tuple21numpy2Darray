### ages and net_worths need to be reshaped into 2D numpy arrays
### second argument of reshape command is a tuple of integers: (n_rows, n_columns)
### by convention, n_rows is the number of data points
### and n_columns is the number of features
ages       = numpy.reshape( numpy.array(ages), (len(ages), 1))
net_worths = numpy.reshape( numpy.array(net_worths), (len(net_worths), 1))
